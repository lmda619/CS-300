# CS-300

What was the problem you were solving in the projects for this course?

We are trying to come up with a way to store and display course information which includes course ID, course Name, and prerequisites, if any, that come from the course information file that ABC University has provided. 

How did you approach the problem? Consider why data structures are important to understand.

I wanted to have information stored and accessed in the most efficient way possible. This is the reason that I picked a Binary Search Tree. Data structures are important to understand because they are more useful in different situations, and they are also the foundation of most projects.

How did you overcome any roadblocks you encountered while going through the activities or project?

Youtube tutorials and forum discussions about the different topics that we covered in the course helped a lot when I got stuck. As C++ is not my strong suit, I struggled a lot with the technical aspects of it. The one thing that I stuggled with at the beginning was that you have to use the functions and classes in the right order for them to work and execute properly.

How has your work on this project expanded your approach to designing software and developing programs?

It made me realize how important it is to have the appropriate data structure for a project. With the right data structure, the application will run smoothly and give users the information that they are trying to access more efficiently. 

How has your work on this project evolved the way you write programs that are maintainable, readable, and adaptable?

I am now able to make a more informed decision whenever I am choosing what structure to use for different projects.
